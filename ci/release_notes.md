# New Features

- The `(( shuffle ))` operator has been added to randomize the order of a list. [Shuffle off and see how to use it!](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce/blob/master/doc/operators.md#-shuffle-)
- Spruce's Dockerfile now includes the ca-certificates Alpine package!

# Acknowledgments

Thanks @jhunt for teaching spruce how to do the `(( shuffle ))`, and @docwhat for adding CA support in the spruce Dockerfile!
