# New Features

- Spruce now has a `(( stringify <REFERENCE> ))` operator! It can turn
  arbitrary yaml datapoints into multi-line strings of yaml data, so you can
  merge your yaml, and eat it too.

  Check out https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce/blob/master/doc/operators.md#-stringify-
  for more details

# Updates
